# Zapp Coding Test

Weâ€™ve got some data in a CSV file and we want to transfer it over to a database and add validation and checks to any changes made to the data. We should be able to add/edit/delete any rows added.

You have been given a sample CSV to test with.

We want you to build a full-stack app using the requirements below and attach a README file. Your README file should contain a brief overview of the approach you took and instructions on how to run it locally. Please also include a small section on how you would set this up and deploy in a cloud environment and why.

We encourage you to spend no more than 3 hours on this test.

## Requirements

- Use nodejs and typescript
- Create a UI for uploading the CSV and performing the above mentioned operations
- Create an backend for handling persistence
- We should be able to run the app locally with your given instructions
- Your code should be hosted on a github repo and shared with us, if you have any issues with this, you can also submit a Google drive link to your code.

You are free to choose whatever framework and tools you wish to use, you can if you wish, use sqllite DB for simplicity.

## What are we looking for

- Tech decisions and any assumptions you made
- Readable and maintanable code
- Approaches to error handling
- Code structure
